# NYT-Article-Search
NYT Article Search application

## Synopsis
This project was developed to fetch articles from the [New York Times Article Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json).
The filters we included in our app were searchable terms, starting and ending dates, and number of articles.  Each article pulled will includes the headline information, date of publication, a short summary, and a link to the full article. We used JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap v. 3.3.7 to develop this app.

## API Reference & Code Example
